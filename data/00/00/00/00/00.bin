  |   We usually don't support XCI dupe releases, specially when it's 9     |
  |   months late after our original eShop pre but this DLC is too nice     |
  |   to be skipped if you are a XCI fanboy and too lazy to convert your    |
  |   NSPs to XCIs.                                                         |
  |   Also, we really had mercy after reading SUXXORS's nfo from            |
  |   Horizon_Chase_Turbo_XCI_NSW-SUXXORS. It seemed they did really feel   |
  |   bad duping us with this XCI 9 months too late, to the point of        |
  |   adding a XCI tag to their release name. As a thank you for that we    |
  |   decided in return to also support your release with this nice DLC.    |
